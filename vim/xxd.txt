hex in vim:
:%!xxd
:%!xxd -r



xxd:
-p | -ps | -postscript | -plain
output in postscript continuous hexdump style. Also known as plain hexdump style.
-r | -revert
reverse operation: convert (or patch) hexdump into binary. If not writing to stdout, xxd writes into its output file without truncating it. Use the combination -r -p to read plain hexadecimal dumps without line number information and without a particular column layout. Additional Whitespace and line-breaks are allowed anywhere.
