\section*{Occupational History}

2012/03 -- now: \\
58.com | Data Department | Algorithms Engineer \\
Research and development about recommendar systhem on groupon, and some work on data mining. \\
\\
2011/04 -- 2012/03: \\
knet | Technology Department | Software Engineer \\
Development on high performance on DNS Server and auto-test tool. \\
\\
2010/03 -- 2011/03: \\
Guo He Xin Cheng | Research Department | Alogorighms Engineer \\
Devolopment Intrusion Detect System based on machine learning. \\





\section*{Project Experience}

2012/03 -- : Recommendar systhem on groupon \\
Development tools: mpi, Hadoop, R \\
Job descriptions: Algorithms research and architecture design. \\
Project detail: The normal recommendar algo works not very well on groupon. With lots of research we develop a new hybrid solution based on paper published by youtube and paper about WAND algo. We use mpi and hadoop for parallel computing. We also develop a ctr predicting at the last filter phase and usd some learning to rank tech. \\
\\
2012/03 -- : Data process and extract \\
Development tools: Hadoop, HDFS, Python \\
Job descriptions: Provide processed data for analysis. \\
Project detail: Coding mapreduce jobs to extract data from hdfs, and transform to other format. \\
\\
2011/09 -- 2012/01: DNS auto-test tools \\
Development tools: Python \\
Job descriptions: Design the framework about auto-test. \\
\\
2011/04 -- 2011/08: DNS Server development \\
Development tools: c \\
Job descriptions: Architecture design and kernel coding. \\
Project detail: We develop a DNS server with bind as back-end and use redis to store user profile. \\
\\
2010/05 -- 2010/08: Modify open source lib broccoli. \\
Development tools: c \\
Job descriptions: Modify source intrusion detection client library broccoli for web services,and increase concurrent processing functions. \\
Project detail: Bro is an open source intrusion detection system,provides a c language library called broccoli to request bro events.But in subsequent process,we use Python to development, so need to change broccoli to a web service.When Python programs need the event of bro, it applys for event to the web service.If web services receive this request,it turns to the bro for event.Once bro produce this event, web service is responsible for forwarding it to the client. \\
\\
2010/03 -- 2011/03: Botnet detection based on machine learning \\
Development tools: Weka, java, Python \\
Job descriptions: Use Weka open source data mining tool for data analysis, choose appropriate classification algorithm, adjust the data set and attribute to improve the accuracy. \\
Project detail: Use open source called intrusion detection system Bro grab the data in the network flow, use network classification algorithm find bots, choose the right machine learning algorithm and the data attribute to improve detection rate. \\
