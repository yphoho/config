\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{float}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{gull}






Specifier   Permission
h   Place the float here, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs in the source text (however, not exactly at the spot)
t   Position at the top of the page.
b   Position at the bottom of the page.
p   Put on a special page for floats only.
!   Override internal parameters Latex uses for determining "good" float positions.
H   Places the float at precisely the location in the LaTeX code. Requires the float package,[1] e.g., \usepackage{float}. This is somewhat equivalent to h!.
