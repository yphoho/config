     -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
             Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be
             forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.  This
             works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side,
             optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a con‐
             nection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port
             hostport from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be
             specified in the configuration file.  IPv6 addresses can be spec‐
             ified by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the
             superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default, the local
             port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting.  How‐
             ever, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection
             to a specific address.  The bind_address of “localhost” indicates
             that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an
             empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be available
             from all interfaces.

     -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
             Specifies that the given port on the remote (server) host is to
             be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.  This
             works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the remote
             side, and whenever a connection is made to this port, the connec‐
             tion is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is
             made to host port hostport from the local machine.

             Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.
             Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in as root on
             the remote machine.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing
             the address in square braces.

             By default, the listening socket on the server will be bound to
             the loopback interface only.  This may be overridden by specify‐
             ing a bind_address.  An empty bind_address, or the address ‘*’,
             indicates that the remote socket should listen on all interfaces.
             Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed if the
             server's GatewayPorts option is enabled (see sshd_config(5)).

             If the port argument is ‘0’, the listen port will be dynamically
             allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time.
             When used together with -O forward the allocated port will be
             printed to the standard output.

ocat本质上就是一个数据管道：从一个数据源接收数据流，然后转发到另外的数据目的地。支持socket,tcp,udp,unix domain,pipe,文件等等几乎各类你能想到和想不到的数据源。socat有海量的参数，可以去看文档（http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html）



With the -R, you can ssh the guest os in virtualbox connected by NAT.
first on guest:
ssh -NR 4000:localhost:22 host
then on host:
ssh -p 4000 localhost
