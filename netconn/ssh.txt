ssh -CNfT -D 127.0.0.1:1234 username@ipaddress

     -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
             stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).  The
             compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the
             “level” can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for pro‐
             tocol version 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines and
             other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast
             networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis
             in the configuration files; see the Compression option.

     -N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just for‐
             warding ports (protocol version 2 only).

     -f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
             This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or
             passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This
             implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a
             remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.

     -T      Disable pseudo-tty allocation.

     -g      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.

     -p port
             Port to connect to on the remote host.  This can be specified on
             a per-host basis in the configuration file.
