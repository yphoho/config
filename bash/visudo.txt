       The sudoers file is composed of two types of entries: aliases
       (basically variables) and user specifications (which specify who may
       run what).

       When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order.
       Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not
       necessarily the most specific match).



   User Specification
        User_Spec ::= User_List Host_List '=' Cmnd_Spec_List \
                      (':' Host_List '=' Cmnd_Spec_List)*

        Cmnd_Spec_List ::= Cmnd_Spec |
                           Cmnd_Spec ',' Cmnd_Spec_List

        Cmnd_Spec ::= Runas_Spec? Tag_Spec* Cmnd

        Runas_Spec ::= '(' Runas_List? (':' Runas_List)? ')'

        Tag_Spec ::= ('NOPASSWD:' | 'PASSWD:' | 'NOEXEC:' | 'EXEC:' |
                      'SETENV:' | 'NOSETENV:' | 'LOG_INPUT:' | 'NOLOG_INPUT:' |
                      'LOG_OUTPUT:' | 'NOLOG_OUTPUT:')




   Runas_Spec
       A Runas_Spec determines the user and/or the group that a command may be
       run as.  A fully-specified Runas_Spec consists of two Runas_Lists (as
       defined above) separated by a colon (':') and enclosed in a set of
       parentheses.  The first Runas_List indicates which users the command
       may be run as via sudo's -u option.  The second defines a list of
       groups that can be specified via sudo's -g option.  If both Runas_Lists
       are specified, the command may be run with any combination of users and
       groups listed in their respective Runas_Lists.  If only the first is
       specified, the command may be run as any user in the list but no -g
       option may be specified.  If the first Runas_List is empty but the
       second is specified, the command may be run as the invoking user with
       the group set to any listed in the Runas_List.  If no Runas_Spec is
       specified the command may be run as root and no group may be specified.

       A Runas_Spec sets the default for the commands that follow it.  What
       this means is that for the entry:

        dgb    boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm

       The user dgb may run /bin/ls, /bin/kill, and /usr/bin/lprm -- but only
       as operator.  E.g.,

        $ sudo -u operator /bin/ls.

       It is also possible to override a Runas_Spec later on in an entry.  If
       we modify the entry like so:

        dgb    boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm

       Then user dgb is now allowed to run /bin/ls as operator, but  /bin/kill
       and /usr/bin/lprm as root.




   Tag_Spec
       A command may have zero or more tags associated with it.  There are
       eight possible tag values, NOPASSWD, PASSWD, NOEXEC, EXEC, SETENV,
       NOSETENV, LOG_INPUT, NOLOG_INPUT, LOG_OUTPUT and NOLOG_OUTPUT.  Once a
       tag is set on a Cmnd, subsequent Cmnds in the Cmnd_Spec_List, inherit
       the tag unless it is overridden by the opposite tag (i.e.: PASSWD
       overrides NOPASSWD and NOEXEC overrides EXEC).




sudoers文件有两种语法：别名，用户规则

用户规则的一个完整表达：
user host = (run_user : run_group) Tag_Spec: cmds

run_user和run_group是说只能用这个用户和组执行：
sudo -u run_user -g run_group xxxx

Tag_Spec可以为：
NOPASSWD, PASSWD, NOEXEC, EXEC, xxxxx


如果没有覆盖，后边的命令会继承run_user和run_group。
