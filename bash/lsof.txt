       Normally list options that are specifically stated  are  ORed  -  i.e.,
       specifying  the  -i option without an address and the -ufoo option pro‐
       duces a listing of all network files OR files  belonging  to  processes
       owned by user ``foo''.

       The -a option may be used to AND the selections.  For example, specify‐
       ing -a, -U, and -ufoo produces a listing of only UNIX socket files that
       belong to processes owned by user ``foo''.
       Caution: the -a option causes all list selection options to  be  ANDed;
       it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of selection options
       by placing it between them, even though its placement there is  accept‐
       able.   Wherever  -a  is  placed, it causes the ANDing of all selection
       options.


lsof -n -a -i tcp -c turpial

sudo lsof -i :53
sudo lsof -p `pgrep named`

mac os x:
       -P       This option inhibits the conversion of port  numbers  to  port
                names  for  network files.  Inhibiting the conversion may make
                lsof run a little faster.  It is also useful  when  port  name
                lookup is not working properly.



lsof -anPi tcp -c iTunes
