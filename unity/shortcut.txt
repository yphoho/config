Mouse Shortcuts/Tricks for Ubuntu Unity

    Clicking and holding an icon and then dragging it around will allow you to reorder it on the launcher. You can also drag it off to the right of the launcher to move it around. Note that you need to make an explicit movement to the right to move the icon off the launcher before you can move it around.
    Dragging and Dropping an icon into the trash can will remove it from the Launcher. 
    Moving and holding the cursor on the left side for a few seconds will launch Unity dock.
    Moving the cursor to top-left corner(near Ubuntu icon) will launch Unity dock as well.
    Scrolling the mouse wheel while over the Launcher scrolls the icons if you have too many and need to move around quickly.
    By Scrolling the mouse wheel while over the Sound icon on top panel helps you increase or decrease system volume.
    Middle click on an application's launcher icon - Open a new instance of the application in a new window. Very useful at times. In laptops with touchpads, hitting left/right click buttons together is akin to middle click.
    Maximizing - Dragging a window to the top panel will maximize it.
    Restore/Unmaximize - Dragging the top panel down OR double clicking on the top panel will do.
    Tiling - Dragging a Window to the left/right border will auto tile it to that side of the screen. One of the highlights of new Unity experience.
